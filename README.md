Hoster
=====

Summary
-------

A *cross-platform* gem that allows you to create, list, and modify local hostnames with ease. This gem was inspired by (and largely based on) the [ghost gem](http://github.com/bjeanes/ghost/tree/master) by Bodaniel Jeanes.

Hoster directly modifies the *hosts* file on you machine to add/remove entries. Because of this, Hoster must be executed as root user (or via *sudo*)


Usage
-----

    $ hoster add testsite.com (defaults to 127.0.0.1)

    $ hoster add testsite.com 192.168.1.150

    $ hoster modify testsite.com 192.168.1.149

    $ hoster remove testsite.com

    $ hoster list (prints entire hosts file)

    $ hoster list 127.0.0.1


Installation
------------

    gem install hoster
